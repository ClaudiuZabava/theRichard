# TheRichard
## _Your Daily Desktop Assistant_

### Long story short:

Hey, let me introduce you to _Richard_ -> an easy to use ( still in development) desktop assistant. (with plans to be upgraded into an AI in the near future).

<br/>

I was working at this project for a few weeks now. When I fisrt started this journey, I was planning to create a small application, an assistant that would make it easier for me to do some of the activities that we all do every day, for example:
- to search for a specific file in vast memory of our computer
- to open the browser manually, to select a search engine and to search for something, either on google or on wikipedia

<br/>

Thus was born, at that time only a .py program runned from teriminal, assistant Richard.
Then I decided I could make it more user-friendly, and started to buitl it's GUI using python-Tkinter.

Then the idea came to me: why not make him 'behave' like a real assistant. 
I had in mind a kind of valet with his own intelligence (in short, an AI made to serve me).

<br/>

So I started improving it:
- I added the functionality to open a video / song on youtube
- I created a stylized GUI for him
- I started working on how to 'communicate' between him and the user (how to respond to greetings, how to respond to what the user tells him to do.)
- It can even tell you some jokes :)

<br/>

It has many things to be implement in order to becoming an AI in the true sense of the word (the reason whi is still in development).
<br/>
Even if Richard currently communicates using a predefined and learned base of words / sentences and commands, it has a functionality through which it memorizes new phrases / words heard from the user, but being still in development, it cannot reuse them yet.
That's why I started a few courses on artificial intelligence, which will help me take this project forward, _bringing Richard to life_
