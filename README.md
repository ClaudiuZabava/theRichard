## _Your Daily Desktop Assistant_

### Long story short:

Hey, let me introduce you to _Richard_ -> an easy to use ( still in development) desktop assistant. (̶w̶i̶t̶h̶ ̶p̶l̶a̶n̶s̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶b̶e̶ ̶u̶p̶g̶r̶a̶d̶e̶d̶ ̶i̶n̶t̶o̶ ̶a̶n̶ ̶A̶I̶ ̶i̶n̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶n̶e̶a̶r̶ ̶f̶u̶t̶u̶r̶e̶)̶.

<br/>

I was working at this project for a few weeks now. When I fisrt started this journey, I was planning to create a small application, an assistant that would make it easier for me to do some of the activities that we all do every day, for example:
- to search for a specific file in vast memory of our computer
- to open the browser manually, to select a search engine and to search for something, either on google or on wikipedia

<br/>

Thus was born, at that time only a .py program runned from teriminal, assistant Richard.
Then I decided I could make it more user-friendly, and started to buitl it's GUI using python-Tkinter.

Then the idea came to me: why not make him 'behave' like a real assistant. 
I had in mind a kind of valet with his own intelligence (̶i̶n̶ ̶s̶h̶o̶r̶t̶,̶ ̶a̶n̶ ̶A̶I̶ ̶m̶a̶d̶e̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶s̶e̶r̶v̶e̶ ̶m̶e̶)̶.̶

<br/>

So I started improving it:
- I added the functionality to open a video / song on youtube
- I created a stylized GUI for him
- I started working on how to 'communicate' between him and the user (how to respond to greetings, how to respond to what the user tells him to do.)
- It can even tell you some jokes :)

<br/>

It has many things to be implement in order to becoming an AI in the true sense of the word (the reason why is still in development).
<br/>
Even if Richard currently communicates using a predefined and learned base of words / sentences and commands, it has a functionality through which it memorizes new phrases / words heard from the user, but being still in development, it cannot reuse them yet.
That's why I started a few courses on artificial intelligence, which will help me take this project forward, _bringing Richard to life_


### User Guide:

**Important:**<br/>
**Make sure to have your favorite BROWSER set as DEFAULT in order to be used by Richard**<br/>
**Richard runs best with OperaGx ( used in the code as well) but works fine with other default browsers.**<br/>
<br/>
#### There are some basic commands:
- _let's play_ / _play_ <some video/song name>  -> Richard will open a new window / tab in the background, playing the given song / video
-  _let's go_ / _go_ <a site name (without www or .com) > -> Richard will search google for that site and will take the first secure result
-  _let's search_ / _search_ <anything to search on google > -> Richard will search something for you on google
- _let's wiki_ / _wiki_ <anything to search on Wiki > -> Same as search, but on Wikipedia.
-  _let's find_ / _find_  <file name and extension (eg: file.exe)> -> Richard will search the given file with the given extension in the current partition ( D by default)
- _let's change dsk_ / _change dsk_ <a partition name on the machine ( D or C or etc..) -> Richard will change the curent search partition.
- _Tell me a joke_  -> Prepare to laugh :)
- Ask _How are you_ or _Hello_ or _Wssup_  -> richard will responde to you.
  
### For Future Updates:
  - Mechanism to learn the new memorised words.
  - More AI fashion interaction methods with user.
